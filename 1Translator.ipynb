While retail investors expect gold prices to be bullish after falling to its lowest level in three months. Many analysts on Wall Street expect gold prices to remain under pressure in the near term as investors focus on the surge in momentum in the stock market. At the same time, analysts say that many investors are turning to bitcoin, which is trading at record highs as a potential new hedge against inflation. \"With investor confidence high at the moment, there isn\\'t much demand for defensive shelters,\" said SIA Wealth Management chief analyst Colin Cieszynski. “Additionally, market participants will look for alternatives to the US dollar and focus more on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies than precious metals.” he added. This week, 14 analysts participated in the Kitco survey. As many as 10 analysts or 71 percent expect gold prices to fall this week. Meanwhile, bullish and neutral analysts got the same vote with 14 percent each. Meanwhile, retail investors who took part in the online survey reached 1,257 votes. Among them, 644 votes or 51 percent said gold prices would be bullish. While 350 other investors or 28 percent said the price of gold will be bearish. Meanwhile, 263 voters or 2i percent were neutral. Gold Price Towards Best Weekly Achievement in 3 Weeks Enlarge Illustration of Precious Metals (iStockphoto)World gold prices are moving steadily, triggered by investors waiting for new catalysts. Although gold prices are on track for their best weekly gain in three weeks, helped by a weaker dollar. Launching the Nasdaq page, Friday (12/2/2021), the price of gold in the spot market was stable at USD 1,825.21 per ounce. Prices rose 0.7 percent in the week. The price of US gold futures slipped 0.1 percent to USD 1,825.40. The dollar exchange rate is heading for its first week of decline in three weeks, due to signals the US job market is weakening which could undermine investors\\' expectations about the speed of recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Noted, US jobless claims fell slightly last week as the labor market continued to decline. But the decline in new COVID-19 cases has boosted cautious optimism that momentum could pick up in the spring. On the other hand, President Joe Biden plans to ask Congress this month to invest heavily in infrastructure after a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package passes Congress in the next few days without significant Republican support. Biden and his Chinese counterpart President Xi Jinping communicated with each other by telephone for the first time on Thursday. Talks appeared to have clashed on many issues, even as Xi warned a confrontation would be \"catastrophic\" for the two countries. \"Slower-than-expected vaccine rollouts and the emergence of coronavirus variants may make herd immunity to COVID-19 difficult, but that shouldn\\'t stop the economy from rebounding,\" according to a U.S. central banker.
